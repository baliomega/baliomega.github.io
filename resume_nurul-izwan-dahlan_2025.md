## PROJECTS PORTFOLIO

### 1. Design Tokens Automation System (2024)
**Focus:** Enterprise-scale token architecture with automation

**Challenge:** Manually syncing design decisions across Figma and multiple codebases led to inconsistencies and 40+ hours/month of maintenance. Teams struggled with implementing dark mode and accessibility modes without a systematic approach.

**Solution:** Built automated token pipeline using Figma Variables, Style Dictionary, and CI/CD integration. Created 1000+ semantic tokens with accessibility mode variants, generating platform-specific code from single source of truth.

**Impact:** 85% reduction in sync time | Instant theme switching | Zero visual inconsistencies | Developer self-service enabled

**Technologies:** Figma Variables, Style Dictionary, CI/CD pipelines, Semantic tokens

---

### 2. Component Library with Token Integration (2025)
**Focus:** Token-driven component architecture

**Challenge:** Creating a unified design language for 50+ enterprise screens while maintaining flexibility for different product needs and ensuring perfect Figma-to-code parity.

**Solution:** Developed modular component library fully integrated with design tokens system. Every component consumes semantic tokens, ensuring automatic updates when tokens change. Implemented variant system in Figma that mirrors component props in code.

**Impact:** 60% faster development | 100% Figma-code consistency | 70% less QA time | 2x faster feature shipping

**Technologies:** React components, Semantic tokens, Figma variants, Storybook

---

### 3. Multi-Platform Design System Scaling (2025)
**Focus:** Cross-platform token deployment

**Challenge:** Maintaining consistency across web, iOS, Android, and React Native platforms with separate design handoffs causing delays and inconsistencies.

**Solution:** Implemented platform-agnostic design token architecture with automated transforms. Single token source generates platform-specific code, enabling synchronized updates across all platforms simultaneously.

**Impact:** 90% reduction in inconsistencies | 45% faster time-to-market | Unified cross-platform releases | Reduced maintenance overhead

**Technologies:** Platform-agnostic tokens, Automated transforms, Multi-platform deployment
